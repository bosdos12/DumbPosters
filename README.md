this is my expressjs + node + react native + mongoose + mongodb "social media *like*" app
Its one of my first react native applications, i actually am uploading it a few weeks after creating it lol
It isnt that great but hey, we all start somewhere, also improved a lot since.

I built this app just to improve my skills as it was a fun project, and it really was fun to build this, i hope u enjoy this app ;).
The server doesnt have any sort of authentication as i never planned on releasing this app to production (due to obvious reasons), so I just made a server to work it at least

ps: the amount of memory leaks in this application will probably make you suicidal.
